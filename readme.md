# Vue Frontend

## Installation

Clone/Download the project and run npm install in the console. When npm is done run npm start and the project should be running on localhost:3000

## Description

In this project I needed to connect my api (https://github.com/RoelVoordendag/RestfulGameApi) to an frontend. For this project I decided to use vue as my frontend framework. It was for me the first time to use vue. In the frontend you can see all the items in the api. When you click on an item it shows more of the details. Here you can choose if you want to delete this item edit it or create another item.
